Methods
method and function refer to the same thing
camel case



name (typed-parameter-list){
    statements
}

Return type -indicates the type of data returned

returntype name (typed-parameter-list){
    statements
}
 
 use void when no value returned

static void doSomething(){

}

static helps compile the code
Parameters enable passing data values to methods


static void showSum(float x,float y, int count){

}
(float...) are our parameters
int count is how many times it will pass through
the parameter receives copies of the values so what is being performed on th evalues within the function does not actually affect the original values;

What makes a mthod exit- end of code, return statements, errors
